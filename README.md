# Custom Vencord Installer

This fork of the Vencord Installer installs the custom [djdoolky76/Vencord](https://github.com/djdoolky76/Vencord) build, including CompleteDiscordQuest.

The installer downloads the `devbuild` release at install or repair time. Every successful push to the custom Vencord repository therefore becomes available automatically; rebuilding this installer is not required for Vencord-only updates.
